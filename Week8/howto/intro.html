      <h1>API Introduction</h1>

      <h2>What is an API?</h2>
      <p>API stands for <b>A</b>pplication <b>P</b>rogram <b>I</b>nterface. This is just vague enough to mean quite a few things, but in
      essence its a method that utilizes abstraction to make it easier for others to get work done. Again, this is rather vague. But in the
      context of the web, an API typically serves to abstract away the complexity of database calls into simple web requests. Maybe an example
      would help.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite activites is reading -- I'm a big news junkie and I love to start the day off by reading the news.
          Since I'm a human with functioning eyeballs, reading the news requires access to information that is inherently readable.
          That is, the content must be organized logically and presented clearly. As a result, newspapers employ designers who's sole job is to take the
        information generated by reporters and make it readable and presentable by using techniques like spacing, color contrast, placement, etc.
      </p>

      <p>However, machines are not like humans. Machines don't care about whitespace, for one, nor are they particularly
        concerned about color contrast or "readability" in the traditional sense. Machines want data, not a lot of fluff designed to make things more readable for us
        meatbags. They want data that is readable to <i>them</i>.
      </p>

      <p>For example, when you go to read a news article online, you might want to see something like this:</p>
      <div class="container"><p><img src="images/ex1.png" class="img-thumbnail"/></p></div>
      <p>But a machine might want to see something like this:</p>
      <div class="container"><p><img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/ex2.png" /></p></div>

      <p>If you look carefully, you will see the two images aren't as different as you might think. Both include the headline,
      the byline, the date the article was posted, not to mention the body of the article itself. These things will be
      obvious to you (a human) in the first photo. But how would a machine know what the headline is? Or whether Jasper
      Jackson is the author or the subject of the article? Or where the article even begins and ends? That's what the
      second shot is for -- a machine can easily go through this list of data to find the headline. It can easily learn
      how to parse the date-time 2016-05-19T23:01:27Z, which might take a human a bit to figure out.</p>

      <p>And so for our purposes here, that's essentially what an API is: <b>a service that provides data a machine can read.</b></p>

      <h2>Where does this data come from?</h2>
      <p>All over the place. Twitter, Reddit, Facebook all have API services. Google itself has dozens of individual APIs for
        Maps, YouTube, etc. There are APIs for weather, sports, people, you name it. Many are free, some are paid. Most have
        restrictions. But the upshot is - there are a lot of organizations out there collecting data from users, and an
        overwhelming amount of that data is available to feed your machine.</p>

      <h2>Wait, so Twitter just gives away its data? For free? Why?</h2>
      <p>Pretty much, yes. I'm not nearly qualified enough to explain why with total confidence, but it has the undeniable
        effect of elevating the profile of these organizations such that their content becomes an indespensible part of the
        web. This is fantastic for them, apparently, but definitely fantastic for rest of us, because it makes building cool applications much easier (and arguably,
        more fun).</p>

      <h2>OK, I get it... I think. Now what?</h2>
      <p>Our focus in this tutorial is on The Guardian's awesome news API. We'll be using the service to pull the same data
        their developers use to build The Guardian website -- in theory, we could recreate the entire site using this data, but we'll just
        focus on building a simple news ticker that utlizes just a few pieces of data out of all that is available.</p>

      <p>To get started, there's just one thing we need to get: an API key!</p>
